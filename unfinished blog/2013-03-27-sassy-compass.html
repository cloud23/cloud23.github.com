<h1>Learning to use SASS and Compass</h1>

<section>
	<article>
		<p>
			First off, let's talk about SASS. SASS or Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets according to <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass-lang.com</a> is a meta-language on top of CSS thatâ€™s used to describe the style of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS allows. SassScript provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, and selector inheritance. These mechanisms were something I wish I had back when I was still working on web applications at my old company. I will not go too much into details on how to use SASS because it is already well explained on the sass-lang website. Instead, I will post here some snippets of CSS scripts from my old project and how I would've made it better had I used SASS on that project.

			<h2>Variable Use</h2>
			Sass allows variable declaration and use throughout the stylesheet. You can declare variable the same way you define a property except you have to put the dollar ($) sign in front of it like this:
{% codeblock %}
$myValue: 100px;
{% endcodeblock %}
			It would've have been great if I were able to use variables in my CSS back then. Lets say I wish to change the primary color I use for my app. Changing it would mean I have to change the color values for these rules:

{% codeblock old css.css %}
h1
{
  padding-top: 0px;
  font-family: Arial;
  color: #004682; /* change this */
}
h2
{
  padding-top: 0px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: #004682; /* and this */
}

a.headlink{
  color: #004682; /* and this */
}
{% endcodeblock %}

			And that's just a few of the rules where I used the primary color. I had to go through all of it just to change something so simple. With sass, I could do something like this:

{% codeblock the sass way.css %}
$primaryColor: #004682; 
h1
{
  padding-top: 0px;
  font-family: Arial;
  color: $primaryColor;
}

h2
{
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: $primaryColor;
  padding-top: 5px;
}

a.headlink{
  color: $primaryColor;
}
{% endcodeblock %}
			So if the client decided to change their mind (again!) about the color, I just have to change it in the main variable I have set.

			1. creating a new project with compass:
				compass create path  [--using blueprint] [--sass-dir=sass ...] [--project-type=rails]
			2. adding compass to an existing project:
				compass init rails path [--using blueprint]
