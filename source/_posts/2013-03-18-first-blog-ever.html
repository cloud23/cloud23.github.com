	I have been in the IT industry for more than 10 years now, but I've never been a big fan of blogging. I read blogs of course, but I am not the type who follows a specific person or group's posts. 
<!-- more -->
	For years, the notion of following or having followers in blog sites elude me and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> for me was like a hill I always pass by on the way to work but never really got the chance to climb. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> has always been enough for me, I can post stuff there for all my friends to see.

	A lot of things changed after I started on my new job. I was now exposed to new things I never bothered to look upon before. I decided to dual boot my laptop and installed Ubuntu, tried my hands on programming on a non-Windows programming language and joined <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, a software development project collaboration site. I said to myself, "this is cool, why didn't I checked it out before?".  
</p>
<p>
	So here I am now, giving blogging a try and exploring new things. It is even more convenient to find out that while learning how to use GIT commands, I can also try out blogging here at GitHub. How's that for multi-tasking? I'm not gonna blabber too much since this is my first post, plus the fact that I have tons of books and tutorials to read. So I am cutting this short for now until my next post!
